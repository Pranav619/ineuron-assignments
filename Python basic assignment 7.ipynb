    "1. What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects? \n",
    "Ans) regex object are generated by re.compile \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects? \n",
    "Ans they are used so that backslash cant be escaped\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the return value of the search() method? \n",
    "It return the object which are matched with the search\n",
    "\n",
    "4. From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern? \n",
    "Group method is used which help to match the string with the pattern \n",
    "\n",
    "5. In the regex which created from the r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)', what does group zero cover? Group 2? Group 1? \n",
    "Group 0 is the entire match i.e from start to end\n",
    ", group 1 covers the first set of parentheses i.e three \\d , \n",
    "and group 2 covers the second set of parentheses i.e inside bracket \n",
    "\n",
    "6. In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods? \n",
    "they can be separated by using escape symbol :  \\., \\(, and \\). and their meaning will specific\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of the two options?\n",
    "if no groups are there then string is returned and if there present groups in regex then lisy of tuple is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. In standard expressions, what does the | character mean? \n",
    "The | character signifies matching \"either, or\" between two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. In regular expressions, what does the character stand for? \n",
    "character are symbols used in regex \n",
    "\n",
    "10.In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters? \n",
    "* includes the empty string i.e 0 or more while + means empty string is not included i.e 1 or more \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression? \n",
    "The {4} matches exactly three instances of the preceding group. The {4,5} matches between four and five instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What do you mean by the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions? \n",
    "these symbols matches a single digit, word, or space character, respectively\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What do means by \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions? \n",
    "The \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes match a single character that is not a digit, word, or space character, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the difference between .*? and .*? \n",
    ".* just means \"0 or more of any character\"\n",
    "\n",
    "15. What is the syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class? \n",
    "we can write [0-9a-z] or [a-z0-9]\n",
    "\n",
    "16. What is the procedure for making a normal expression in regax case insensitive? \n",
    "re.I will make the regax case insensitive or re.IGNORECASE as the second argument to re.compile()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "17. What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as 2nd argument in re.compile()? \n",
    "The . character normally matches any character except the newline character. If re.DOTALL is passed as the second argument to re.compile(), then the dot will also match newline characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. If numReg = re.compile(r'\\d+'), what will numRegex.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hen') return? \n",
    "It will return the following :\n",
    "'X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hens'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "19. What does passing re.VERBOSE as the 2nd argument to re.compile() allow to do? \n",
    "The re.VERBOSE argument allows you to add whitespace and comments to the string passed to re.compile().\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "20. How would you write a regex that match a number with comma for every three digits? It must match the given following: '42' '1,234' '6,368,745\n",
    "re.compile(r'^\\d{1,3}(,\\d{3})*$') will create this regex, but other regex strings can produce a similar regular expression."
