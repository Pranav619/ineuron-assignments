    "ans) five levels are :  DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL\n",

    "7. What line of code would you add to your software to disable all logging messages?\n",
    "logging.disable(logging.CRITICAL)\n",
    "\n",
    "8.Why is using logging messages better than using print() to display the same message?\n",
    "You can disable logging messages without removing the logging function calls. \n",
    "You can selectively disable lower-level logging messages.\n",
    "You can create logging messages. \n",
    "Logging messages provides a timestamp.\n",

    "9. What are the differences between the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger?\n",
    "ans) \n",
    "The Step button will move the debugger into a function call. The Over button will quickly execute the function call without stepping into it. The Out button will quickly execute the rest of the code until it steps out of the function it currently is in.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10.After you click Continue, when will the debugger stop ?\n",
    "Ans ) click Go, the debugger will stop when it has reached the end of the program or a line with a breakpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is the concept of a breakpoint?\n",
    "ans)It is a tool that allows developers to set points in code at which a debugger is called. By default, this function results in an instantiation of Python's native debugger class"
