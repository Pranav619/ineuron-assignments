    "1. What exactly is []?\n",
    "Ans )  these are square operator and used for enclosing the index\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the\n",
    "third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)\n",
    "ans) spam[2] ='hello'\n",

    "3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?\n",
    "Ans) the value will be--- 'd'\n",

    "4. What is the value of spam[-1]?\n",
    "Ans) The value will be -- 'd'\n",

    "ans) index will be : 1\n",
    "\n",
    "7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?\n",
    "ans)new list will be:  [3.14, 'cat', 11,'cat', True ,99]\n",
    "\n",
    "8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?\n",
    "Ans) new list will be : [3.14, 11,'cat', True,99]\n",

    "9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?\n",
    "ans) list concatenation : + , while the operator for replication :  *\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "ans) append adds in the end of the list while insert can be used to add at any speicific position.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",
    "ans) first one is remove and second one is pop() and clear() can be used to remove all\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "ans) both have indexes and slices\n",
    "both can be passed to len()\n",
    "both can be concatenated and replicated \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "Ans) Tuples are static while lists are dynamic.  \n",
    "also lists are mutable while tuples are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
    "ans) we can use the trailing comma \n",
    "ex:  s1=('42',)\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",
    "ans) we can pass the tuple inside -> list()  to make it a list form\n",
    "or we can pass the list inside --> tuple()  to make it a tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they\n",
    "contain?\n",
    "ans) they may contain referenceto the list values\n",
    "\n",
    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()? (learnt while doing assignment:)  ) \n",
    "Ans) A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and then (to the extent possible) inserts references into it to the objects found in the original.\n",
    "A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, recursively, inserts copies into it of the objects found in the original."
