    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "ANS1) because functions allow us to use same code again and again , without actually typing it.\n",
    "we can also break our problem into smaller parts or functions and then solve it accordingly.\n",
    "we don't need to know the working instead we only need input,output and where it lives thus fn.follows \n",
    "abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when its specified or when its called?\n",
    "ANS2) The code of the function only runs when it is called , after calling the fn program left the code and \n",
    "begin to execute the first of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "Ans) Def keyword with function name and parenthisis in the end with colon  ---- creates a fn in a code\n",
    "example--  def name():\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "ans) Function is the part where we write the code for it and give the name tand all speific things related to the function \n",
    "but after making it \n",
    "when we want to use it we call for the name of it and it is where the actual running orimplementation of the \n",
    "function took place.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "Ans)There is only one global scope in python program otherwise it would be impractical and for\n",
    "local scope there are only one types of it which is when it is declared inside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "ans)The local variable can be used outside the function any time after the function call completes and\n",
    "local variable retains its value until the next time the function\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "ans) Return value end the recursiveness of a function and a function will end after seeing a return value and\n",
    " If the return statement is without any expression, then the special value None is returned.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "ans) it would return none\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "Ans) To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword. \n",
    "or if it is declared outside the fnctions then it is a global variable \n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "None has a NONEtype of data type itself and is used to define a null value, or no value at all. None is not the same as 0, False, or an empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "it will import this module \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "Ans )  spam.bacon()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "Ans ) best we can use is error handling that is use try and except block\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "ans) try statements are used as If the statement is successful, both except clauses are skipped and the code inside the finally clause is run.\n",
    "If the statement inside the try block fails, the code in the first except statement is executed.\n"
